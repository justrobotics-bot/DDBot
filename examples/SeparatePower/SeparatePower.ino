  This is an example test file for a library that allows you to run a robot using an L293D driver for
  differential drive. This example demostrates the power control functionality, which allows you to adjust how
  much power is being delivered to the motors.

  Two PWM pins are used in this example to control the power to the motors, presumably one for each of the
  left and right motors.

  The raw values are used for digitalWrite() in order of the DIO pin: (LF, LB, RF, RB). For example, the code
  for rotating clockwise (1, 0, 0, 1) corresponds to
    digitalWrite(_LF, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(_LB, LOW);
    digitalWrite(_RF, LOW);
    digitalWrite(_RB, HIGH);

  Pin connections expected by this code:
    2   - LF - Left forward motor pin
    3   - LB - Left backward motor pin
    4   - RF - Right forward motor pin
    5   - RB - Right backward motor pin
    10  - PL - Left power control PWM pin
    11  - PR - Right power control PWM pin
*/

// Include the library into the sketch
#include <DDBot.h>

// Define the DIO and PWM pins to be used for controlling the motors
DDBot motors (2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11); // Here, an instance of the class is called and it is named "motors". You
// can choose a different name if you wish.
/* Possible syntaxes
  DDBot (int LF, int LB, int RF, int RB);
  DDBot (int LF, int LB, int RF, int RB, int PC);
  DDBot (int LF, int LB, int RF, int RB, int PL, int PR);

  The third method above is used here.

// Setup code that runs only once
void setup() {
  motors.init();  // Initialize the library; this specifies the pinModes
}

// Loop code that runs infinitely many times
void loop() {

  /*  Syntax for setPower()
      You can specify the power that must be given to the motors, as a percentage (0 to 100), internally
      scaled from 0 to 255 for the PWM duty cycle.

      If you specify only one value in the arguments like this
        setPower(62);
      the program assumes that you have specified only one pin (PC) for power, presumably common to both
      motors.

      If you specify two values in the arguments like this
        setPower(48, 90);
      the program assumes that the first is for the left motor (PL) and the second for the right motor (PR).
